# Number of nodes to build the external functions grid.
#    If Method = InnerGrid, then NumberNodes is ignored and the nodes grid will be built following the
# same node separation defined in the GBTOlib input file (SCATCI.INP), doing the propper matching with the
# inner B-splines and placing the last node position as close as possible to Rmax.
#
#    If Method = UniformGrid, then using NumberNodes and Rmax, am equidistand grid of nodes is built, doing the
# matching with the inner B-splines. If the resultant node separation for the external B-splines is too different
# from the one used for the internal B-splines, the wave function representation might be compromised. In that case
# it would be better to use the 'File' method.
#
#    If Method = File, then the first NumberNodes values will be taken from the list defined at the end of the
# file, and with these values will define the nodes grid, ignoring Rmax. If the first value in the list is lower
# than the last node position for the inner B-splines, ASTRA will stop the execution and will print a message
# addressing this fact, the user to modify the list. If the first value in the list is too far from the last
# node position for the inner B-splines, then the wave function representation might be compromissed around that
# point. In order to avoid this it is advisable to start the list at a distance comparable with the inner nodes
# separation, from the last inner node, and from that point on, to make a smooth transition to the external
# nodes separation of interest.
