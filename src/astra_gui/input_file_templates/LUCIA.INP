* For linear molecules, it computes the LZ projection along the internuclear axis.

* If the state-averaged LUCIA calculations is included in the ASTRA call, the MOFRLU keyword
* must be uncommented in order to load the new optimized molecular orbitals and not the
* original ones from DALTON. If there is no state-averaged call MOFRLU must be commented just
* to read the orbitals generated by DALTON.

* - number of CI spaces, done in sequence,
*   normally assumed to be an inclusion chain
*   and each calculation uses the previous one a starting point
* - at least ten electrons and at most ten electrons in GASSPC
* - in alternative to N_el N_el, which is equivalent to Full CI,
*   one can just indicate FCI instead
GASSPC * The same number of active electrons are repeated twice.

* MUSYMU:
* Number of lines defining the states.
** Number of states per spatial symmetry (first), multiplicity (second) and number of
** states (third). For each state, specify the symmetry (DALTON order) and the multiplicity
** As a consequence, the states are taken in sequence, in increasing energy
