# Logging Review Notes

- Message style is inconsistent across modules (mixed punctuation and casing), e.g. `src/astra_gui/utils/ssh_client.py:124`, `src/astra_gui/app.py:139`, and `src/astra_gui/utils/table_module.py:61`. Consider adopting a shared “<action>: <details>” convention for readability.
- Severity levels are often mismatched to the situation. Recoverable validation flows emit `error` (`src/astra_gui/app.py:180`, `src/astra_gui/close_coupling/lucia.py:188`, `src/astra_gui/utils/table_module.py:61`), while `_ssh_setup` reports success regardless of earlier failures (`src/astra_gui/utils/ssh_client.py:167-180`). Revisit each call site to demote informational issues to `warning`/`info`, raise exceptions for programmer errors, and only use `error` when the workflow cannot continue.
- Verbose mode (`--verbose`) produces high-volume chatter from UI state transitions and polling (`src/astra_gui/utils/statusbar_module.py:42-52`, `src/astra_gui/utils/notebook_module.py:612-633`). Audit `info` logs that fire on every tick and move the noisiest ones to `debug`.
- Long-running operations, such as the background runner in `src/astra_gui/utils/notebook_module.py:550-594`, lack instrumentation around command invocation and failures. Adding debug/info logs for each executed command (including stderr on failure) would make remote issues easier to diagnose.
- `setup_logger` clears all existing handlers before installing its own (`src/astra_gui/utils/logger_module.py:91-107`). Document this side effect or guard against stripping handlers that third-party libraries attach before the CLI runs.
- Current tests (`tests/test_logger_module.py`) verify level selection but not downstream behaviour that depends on logging (e.g., background operations, SSH helpers). Expanding coverage—especially around noisy paths and severity expectations—would catch regressions early.
