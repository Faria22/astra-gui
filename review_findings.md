# Code Review Findings

1. `src/astra_gui/utils/logger_module.py:34` — `CustomLogger.error()` exits the process (`sys.exit(1)`). Many components rely on `logger.error` for recoverable conditions (e.g., config parsing failures, unsupported notification settings, SSH misconfiguration). This makes the GUI terminate instead of surfacing the issue. You already confirmed the exit-on-error policy should be removed, so replace this behaviour with standard logging and let callers decide how to handle fatal errors.
2. `src/astra_gui/app.py:397-402` — `copy_template()` calls `get_running_dir(...)` expecting the selected template path, but `get_running_dir` only updates internal state and always returns `None`. The guard at line 402 exits early, so template copying never occurs. Adjust the helper to return the chosen path (or build a dedicated dialog helper) so the copy logic runs.
3. `src/astra_gui/app.py:414` — Remote copy uses `mv -r`, which is invalid (`mv` lacks `-r`) and would delete the source template even if it worked. Switch to a recursive copy (`cp -r`) or an SFTP-based copy mirroring `shutil.copytree`.
4. `src/astra_gui/app.py:407` — Remote cleanup checks `self.ssh_client.path_exists(Path(folder))`, which resolves relative to the remote home instead of `self.running_directory`. The `rm` never triggers when `QC`/`store` exist under the run directory. Check and delete using `self.running_directory / folder`.
5. `src/astra_gui/utils/statusbar_module.py:33` — `message_queue.pop()` treats the queue as a stack (LIFO). Messages added first are shown last or skipped. Replace with FIFO semantics (e.g., `pop(0)` or `collections.deque`) so status updates display in the order enqueued.
